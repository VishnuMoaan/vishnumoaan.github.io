          I'm Vishnu Moaan, Sr. Software Engineer, Automation Architect, and AI Engineer with nearly a decade of experience building reliable, scalable, and intelligent quality engineering solutions.
          I currently work as a Team Lead and Scrum Master, leading a 13-member team and driving end-to-end testing strategy across automation, CI/CD, and customer-focused validation. My work spans test framework design, automation scripting, API testing, and Agile delivery, with a strong focus on reducing manual effort and improving release confidence.
          Over the years, I've designed and implemented AI-assisted testing solutions, including customer acceptance validation, test case optimization, and intelligent scenario generation. I enjoy blending traditional automation with modern AI techniques to solve real testing and productivity problems.
          Beyond execution, I'm deeply interested in building tools and platforms—from Windows and web applications to AI-powered assistants—that help teams work smarter, ship faster, and think beyond repetitive testing.

        <p class="muted">
          My interests include applied machine learning, automation, data engineering workflows, and AI-assisted products.
